# Supplementary Jupyter notebook to "Lgr5+ stem/progenitor cells reside at the apex of the embryonic hepatoblast pool"

The Jupyter notebook [prior_et_al_2019_sequencing_analysis.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fabianrost84/prior_et_al_2019/blob/master/prior_et_al_2019_sequencing_analysis.ipynb) contains the single cell sequencing analysis for our paper [Lgr5+ stem/progenitor cells reside at the apex of the embryonic hepatoblast pool](https://doi.org/10.1101/485870).

The anaysis was mainly done using scanpy. The file `environment.yml` contains an export of the conda environment that we used for our analysis.
